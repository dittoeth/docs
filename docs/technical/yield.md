# Yield

1. **dETH yield** is staked ETH rewards.
   - This yield comes from yield gained from LST ETH in the system
   - This yield is distributed to existing `shortRecords`
2. **Token yield** is the system's token, given as additional rewards.
   - This yield is minted at a fixed rate
     - for existing `shortRecords`
     - for providing liquidity on the OrderBook

| dETH location              | dETH yield | token yield             |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| outside system (withdrawn) | no         | no                      |
| inside system (escrowed)   | no         | no                      |
| on orderbook (limit order) | no         | yes (after time period) |
| matched (shortRecord)      | yes        | yes                     |

## dETH Yield

The system is denominated in dETH. Any deposited ETH tokens (ETH, rETH, stETH) are converted into dETH.

dETH is only a stablecoin for ETH. It does not gain any yield on its own or by holding it. Instead, all dETH yield - generated by the underlying LST - is given to matched shorters in the system (ie. in a `shortRecord` position). Any dETH that is not matched has no claim to yield generated by the system and cedes yield to matched shorters. This includes dETH outside the system, inside the system, and on the orderbook. Hence, yield for matched shorters becomes supercharged as they are eligible for yield beyond just their provided collateral.

| dETH location              | `shortRecord` yield capture |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| outside system (withdrawn) | x%                          |
| inside system (escrowed)   | x%                          |
| on orderbook (limit order) | x%                          |
| collateral from shorter    | 100%                        |
| collateral from bidder     | 100%                        |

For example with `initialCR` = 2, a shorter would be guaranteed at least 50% (1 ETH from bidder/ 2 ETH from shorter) yield beyond simply holding the equivalent ETH value of LST. In practice, this figure would be higher as the shorter also receives x% (where x > 0) of the yield generated from dETH from non-matched positions. This percentage is determined proportionally by the collateral in a `shortRecord` compared to the collateral in all `shortRecords`.

**Eligibility Criteria:**

- Only applies to `shortRecord`.
- `shortRecord` created/modified more than `YIELD_DELAY_SECONDS` ago.
  - Upon creation, `shortRecord` starts accruing yield, but it's only eligible to claim after waiting `YIELD_DELAY_SECONDS`.
  - This protects against flash loans where a user could open massive short positions to artificially harvest yield. Since LST are continuously generating yield, lagtime exists between LST yield and when it's recorded in the system due to the discrete (but cheaper) manner of calling `updateYield()`. Therefore, matching a `shortRecord` immediately before calling `updateYield()` can give a shorter access to a disproportionate amount of dETH yield that was generated before the `shortRecord` even existed.

**Accrual Mechanism:**

Similar to Uniswap's concept of feeGrowth, dETH yield is tracked by a monotonically increasing global rate. `dethYieldRate` is defined as the yield earned per unit of collateralized dETH over all `shortRecords` in the same `Vault`, since only dETH collateralized in a `shortRecord` is eligible to earn yield.

$dethYieldRate = dethYieldRate + {yield \over dethCollateral}$

Upon creation, each `shortRecord` reads the current `dethYieldRate` and saves it as a parameter. When yield is distributed, the updated `dethYieldRate` is compared against the last saved `dethYieldRate` and the difference - the yield differential per unit of dETH collateralized - is multiplied by the amount of `dethCollateral` in a given `shortRecord` to determine the amount of dETH yield. The new updated `dethYieldRate` is then written to the `shortRecord` to eliminate double counting of yield.

$yield = (Vault.dethYieldRate - short.dethYieldRate) * short.dethCollateral$

> **Note**: Updating `dethYieldRate` is a discrete process initiated by calling `updateYield()`. `dethYieldRate` must increase by at least 1 wei for a successful call.
> **Note**: Receiving yield depends on the user calling `distributeYield(assets[])` for assets in which they have created `shortRecords`. Relying on user initiated calls avoids the gas-intensive method of tracking all `shortRecords` and looping through them.

## TAPP

The Treasury Asset Protection Pool (`TAPP`) stores the treasury's percentage of yield via `dethTithePercent` as a system fee, and can be used to cover bad debt

## Token Yield

### From Matching

To bootstrap and incentivize liquidity on the OrderBook, rewards are provided for matched limit orders that have been sitting on the OrderBook over a certain time period, akin to how an AMM like Uniswap may reward liquity providers (LPs).

**Eligibility Criteria:**

- Only applies to `shortOrder` and `bidOrder`. Excludes `askOrder`.
- If an `Order` is cancelled, the user will lose their rewards because rewards are earned only upon successfully matching.
  - A partially filled `Order` can generate rewards proportional to the amount filled.
- The parameter `creationTime` is tracked in `Order` to determine if it's past the minimum duration required to be rewarded. This protects against two types of exploitative behavior:
  1. Users borrowing large sums to place limit orders solely to get rewards. When `creationTime` is appropriately determined, these users will have to weigh the cost of borrowing against potential rewards.
  2. Users arbitrarily creating and matching market orders and the use of flash loans to get rewards.

**Accrual Mechanism:**

User rewards are determined proportionally by the number of user shares in comparison to the total shares by `Vault`. The total number of shares in the `Vault` (totalShares) and the total amount of reward available to claim (totalReward) are dynamic values. Thus, the amount of reward claimed by a user is not static and is dependent on the `Vault` conditions at the time of claim.

$userReward = totalReward * {userShares \over totalShares}$

- Users generate userShares (`dittoMatchedShares`) denominated in ETH-seconds, by the product of the `Order` amount (in ETH) and time until match (in seconds).
- Upon claiming token reward the entire balance of userShares is "used" and the balance is zeroed out.
- totalShares increases and decreases as users gain and redeem shares.

The totalReward (`dittoMatchedReward`) is updated by user claims according to the per second rate `dittoMatchedRate` and the elapsed time since the last call of `claimDittoMatchedReward`. While the amount of totalReward is dynamic, the accrual occurs at a fixed rate meaning a fixed amount of token minting over time.

$dittoMatchedReward = elapsedTime * dittoMatchedRate$

### From Shorts

Holders of `shortRecords` also receive token rewards in addition to dETH yield in order to further incentivize holding short positions. However, instead of developing another separate system of shares, these token rewards simply scale with the amount of dETH yield that a user has claimed. This simpler mechanism saves gas without introducing new state variables and is also not static like the above method.

$dittoReward = dittoRewardShortersTotal * {dittoYieldShares \over dittoYieldSharesTotal}$

- dittoYieldShares is the immediate amount of dETH yield being distributed to a user during a call of `distributeYield(assets[])` that is modified by a reduction factor inversely proportional to CR (`initialCR/CR`) that is capped at 100%.

  - The proportional reduction is designed to incentivize users to utilize excess capital efficiently and for the creation of new debt, while discouraging the creation of `shortRecords` with high CR that are over-stuffed with collateral. This disincentive model exists alongside the inherent lower capital efficiently of holding `shortRecords` with high CR.
  - This reduction for higher CR discourages reward farming by eliminating ditto tokens earned by all collateral beyond what would be needed to maintain a `shortRecord` at the CR derived from `initialCR`.
  - Since `decreaseCollateral()` does not credit users with ditto tokens there is no benefit to decreasing collateral immediately before a yield distribution in order to lower a short position CR.

- dittoYieldSharesTotal is recorded in `Vault.dethCollateralReward` as the total dETH reward that has been claimed over the life of the `Vault`.

- `dittoRewardShortersTotal` accrual is also simpler than the above method because protocol time is used instead of elapsed time, multiplied by `Vault.dittoShorterRate`. This simpler method can be implemented since dETH yield inherently rewards earlier owners of `shortRecords` by the use of `dethYieldRate`.

$dittoRewardShortersTotal = protocolTime * dittoShorterRate$

## Functions

Per Vault:

- `updateYield(vault)` checks if the underlying LST ETH has increased in value, and if so it will update the global `Vault.dethYieldRate`.
- `claimDittoMatchedReward(vault)` will distribute system tokens to a user from all OrderBooks for any matched orders over the minimum duration.

Per User:

- `distributeYield(assets[])` will loop over a list of assets and loop through a user's `shortRecords` to increase both a user's dETH yield and token yield.
  - dETH yield is added to a user's `ethEscrowed` so they can withdraw as normal.
- `withdrawDittoReward(vault)` will mint the system token to a user's wallet.

Other:

- `disburseCollateral` is an internal function that is called whenever collateral "leaves" a `shortRecord`. This is similar to `distributeYield` but pertains to a particular `shortRecord` and distributes yield only for the amount of collateral that is being decreased. This way unrealized yield that was not distributed is captured before permanent loss. `YIELD_DELAY_SECONDS` is also utilized here to prevent flash loan exploits that quickly make shorts and exit them. When this time condition is not satisfied, the distributed yield is sent to the TAPP instead of the `shortRecord` owner.
