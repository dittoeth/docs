## Why use LSD ETH?

ETH is an _exogenous_ collateral to this system, external to it, so the system cannot control the supply.

- Examples like what [happened](https://twitter.com/aklamun/status/1396615719228424196?s=20) with Terra/LUNA explain the issue of _endogenous_ (internal to the system) collateral or seigniorage shares. It lead to a fast rise up and death spiral down (in the case of a bank run). Since same stablecoin system controls the supply of the collateral, it leads to highly reflexive behavior and volatility. The team was free to mint an infinite amount of LUNA to keep the price of Terra stable, until it's inevitable failure.

There is little incentive to be a shorter with a non-staking collateral, if that collateral could of been used to stake. Staking is the base action to compare all actions against, so LSD ETH is being adopted over ETH itself post-Merge.

## What are the user incentives?

- **Buyers** want a stable asset (zETH -> USD).
- **Shorters** want extra yield for their ETH, which comes from the buyer side as well as any unmatched zETH.
- **Askers** want to swap the stable asset back for collateral (USD -> zETH).
- **Primary Margin Callers** get a reward for liquidating.
- **Secondary Margin Callers** want to swap asset for collateral if asset peg might break (USD -> zETH).
